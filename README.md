WIP

I just wanted to add a disclaimer that as it stands, this project is not functional. I do very much intend to finish it, however, I am attending university right now and have very little free time.

# μCaster 
(mucaster)

Once completed, μCaster is a cross-platform Chromecast controller that can play files directly from a host computer. This project is directly inspired by Gnomecast and Videostream while aiming to provide a more lightweight, terminal/webapp based, cross-platform alternative. The webapp merely serves as an interface and can be swapped/supplemented freely, provided a matching API is used.

Windows and Linux are the only supported platforms. MacOS may work, however will never actively be tested or supported (by me).   

## Acknowledgments

* This project would not be possible without [rust-cast](https://github.com/azasypkin/rust-cast).   
* File conversion is performed by the ubiquitous [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) and supplied via [ffmpeg-next](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg).
* Finally, without inspiration from [Gnomecast](https://github.com/keredson/gnomecast) I would have never started this project.
